## Why use Berri vs. raw ChatGPT? 

Since chatGPT has a limited context window (~4k tokens), it's hard to pass large amounts of information (e.g. Database, notion docs, etc.) into it. Berri abstracts the complexity of getting chatGPT to work on your large data, with a simple API endpoint. Want to tinker / improve results? reach out @ krrish@berri.ai, and we'll help you get set-up.

# Scenarios
Our API endpoints let you spin up chatGPT apps for any scenario you might envision. However, we also provide presets for common scenarios. 

Today, we offer presets for `customer support` and `spreadsheet question-answering`. Look at our endpoint documentation to cover these in more detail.
