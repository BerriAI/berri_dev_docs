Hey <person name>,
I’d love to try solving <insert your problem> with chatGPT. I think we could do this using BerriAI - they’re an API to let us automatically create custom chatGPT instances finetuned on our data.
They enable on-prem hosting, and can deploy chatGPT-like models (eg. t5) onto our infra.
Here’s a link to their privacy policy: https://docs.berri.ai/api-reference/faqs-support/data
And a link to the founders calendly if you’d like to schedule some time to chat with them: https://calendly.com/d/xz2-fqd-gqz/berri-ai-ishaan-krrish
Regards,
<your name>
