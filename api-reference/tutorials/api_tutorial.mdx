BerriAI provides a fast and efficient way to create a chatGPT app for your data programmatically.

Just looking to play around and make quick tweaks to your app? Try our playground - berri.ai/. 

Follow the steps below to create your app in Python:
Here is a link to a replit if you want to jump right into the code: https://replit.com/join/ifraaoxeki-krrishdholakia

## Step 1: Create a Template

You need to create your app configuration. Go [here](../app_configurations/app_configurations_intro) to learn more. 

```python
url = "https://api.berri.ai/create_template"

app_config = {"advanced": {"intent": "qa_doc", "search": "default"}, "prompt": "Be legal and ethical", "output_length": "256"} 

data = {"app_config": json.dumps(app_config)}

response = requests.post(url, data=data)
print(response.text)
```

## Step 2: Create an App
Creating an app requires 3 things: 
1. User email: so we can map the created app to your account 
2. Template Id: pass in the id for the app configuration you created 
3. Data source: This is either the file or url (website or api endpoint) you'd like to query.

For now, let's do it on a sample pdf. 


Ensure that you are reading the file and sending its contents. 
This works for PDF, DOC, TXT, CSV, and PPTX files.
```python
template_id = "307d7a0d-242c-49c8-9108-47b8bf917424"

url = "https://api.berri.ai/create_app"

data = {"template_id": template_id, "user_email": "krrish@berri.ai"}

files = {'data_source': open('quizlet_wa_test_1.pdf', 'rb')}

response = requests.post(url, files=files, data=data)

print(response.text)

```

## Step 3: Try your app! 

Congratulations, you've just built your first Berri app. 

You can share this app with your friends with the website_endpoint, or integrate this into your app with the api_endpoint! 

Here's an example of how you can query the api endpoint: 

```python
url = api_endpoint

user_query = "What do you know?"

final_url = api_endpoint + user_query

response = requests.get(final_url)

print(response.text)

system_response = response.json()["response"]

```
