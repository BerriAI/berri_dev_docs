BerriAI provides a fast and efficient way to create a chatGPT app for your data programmatically.
Follow the steps below to create your app in Python:
Here is a link to a replit if you want to jump right into the code: https://replit.com/join/bhijvqeihh-ishaan-jaff

## Step 1: Set Berri's URL as a POST endpoint
```python
url = "https://sharedinfraingestserver-qic2.zeet-berri.zeet.app/berri_pipeline".

# Call BerriAI's API endpoint
```

## Step 2: Set Params for creating your Berri
Set your email for your account and select the file you are creating the project for. 
Ensure that you are reading the file and sending its contents. 
This works for PDF, DOC, TXT, CSV, and PPTX files.
```python
querystring = {"user_email": "ishaan@berri.ai"}
files = {'file': open('article.txt', 'rb')}

```

## Step 3: Make a POST request to the Berri endpoint with the arguments
```python
response = requests.post(url, files=files, params=querystring)

```

## Step 4: Receive your API endpoint 
The response should be in the following format:
```
{
    "api_endpoint":"https://shareddbstorequery-7bea-8hjw.zeet-berri.zeet.app/berri_query?proj_path=indexes/ishaan@berri.ai/2108ac68-f741-477b-896a-2fc68c8ca0a1&query=",
    "website_endpoint":"chat.berri.ai/aHR0cHM6Ly9zaGFyZWRkYnN0b3JlcXVlcnktN2JlYS04aGp3LnplZXQtYmVycmkuemVldC5hcHAvYmVycmlfcXVlcnk_cHJval9wYXRoPWluZGV4ZXMvaXNoYWFuQGJlcnJpLmFpLzIxMDhhYzY4LWY3NDEtNDc3Yi04OTZhLTJmYzY4YzhjYTBhMQ=="
}

```

## Step 5 Call your API Endpoint with user queries 
Example Postman request
This Postman request is calling the API endpoint generated by Berri in Step 4 of the tutorial. The endpoint is a URL that points to a server that hosts the chatbot created by Berri. The request includes two query parameters:

proj_path: This parameter specifies the project path of the chatbot. In this case, it is set to indexes/ishaan@berri.ai/2108ac68-f741-477b-896a-2fc68c8ca0a1, which is the path to the chatbot created by Berri for the user ishaan@berri.ai.

query: This parameter specifies the user query that the chatbot should respond to. In this case, it is set to When are my taxes due ?, which is a sample query.

When the Postman request is sent to the API endpoint, the server processes the query and returns a response that contains the chatbot's answer to the query.
```

```


All the code used to make the request to create your Berri App
```
import requests

url = "https://sharedinfraingestserver-qic2.zeet-berri.zeet.app/berri_pipeline"

querystring = {"user_email": "ishaan@berri.ai"}

files = {'file': open('article.txt', 'rb')}

response = requests.post(url, files=files, params=querystring)

print(response.text)

```
