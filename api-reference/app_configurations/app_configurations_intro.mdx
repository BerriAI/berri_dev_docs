# What is an App Configuration 

An app configuration is a simple way to explain how you want your app to work. Some simple questions it could help answer - what sort of data do you want to input? what kind of prompt do you want to call each time you create a new app? what sort of questions do you expect your users to ask?

**Note** You can always come back and change your app configurations! One way of testing different configurations is on our playground - berri.ai/. 

## Types of App Configurations 

Today, Berri supports 2 types of App Configs. This is primarily influenced by the data type you're submitting. 

1. [URL Configs](/url_configuration) (Use this if you want to query a scraped website, or connect with an API Endpoint)
2. [File Configs](/file_configuration) (Use this if you want to upload a single file - .csv, .pdf. .docx, .txt, .pptx **or** multiple files - .zip)
