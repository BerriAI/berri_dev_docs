Berri offers you 2 primary ways of creating a chatGPT app

### 1. Quick Start / Single File Upload
Use Case: Good for doing QA on single documents (e.g. .pdf, .docx, .txt, .pptx, .csv). 


### 2. Folder Upload
Use Case: Good for doing QA on multiple data types at once. More control offered. 

**Note**: If it takes you longer than 5 minutes to spin up your app, email us a screenshot @ krrish@berri.ai and we'll buy you coffee wherever you are.
