Berri offers you 2 primary ways of creating a chatGPT app

### 1. Website / Single File Upload
Use Case: Good for doing QA on website (e.g. company website) or single documents (e.g. .pdf, .docx, .txt, .pptx, .csv). 


### 2. Folder Upload
Use Case: Good for doing QA on multiple data types at once. More control offered. 

# Scenarios
Our API endpoints let you spin up chatGPT apps for any scenario you might envision. However, we also provide presets for common scenarios. 

Today, we offer presets for `customer support` and `spreadsheet qa`. Look at our endpoint documentation to cover these in more detail. 

**Note**: If it takes you longer than 5 minutes to spin up your app, email us a screenshot @ krrish@berri.ai and we'll buy you coffee wherever you are.
